                        <p>The Marylebone Mountaineering Club was founded in 1974 and boasts around 100 members who live
                            mostly in
                            and around London.

                            The activities of the club are centred around the once monthly meets which take place all
                            over
                            the UK.
                            Many informal trips are also organised outside of the meet program with foreign trips,
                            typically
                            to the
                            Alps or sport climbing in Spain and Italy. </p>
                        <p>As with other clubs there are various excursions to the London climbing walls and a large
                            group
                            go to The
                            Castle on regular basis.

                            Membership is £18 a year and is open to anyone over 18. The club is affiliated to the BMC,
                            and
                            members
                            will receive the same benefits as individual members of the BMC (third party insurance, free

                            clubs,

                            The Castle and The Arch but on a more informal basis.</p>
                        <p>Their trips away schedule seems less formal than the other London Climbing Clubs in this

                            but

                            in
                            London,
                            as you will see by there extremely busy meet schedule.

                            The club covers all aspects of mountaineering, from rock climbing to hill walking, high
                            mountaineering

                        <h3>The 8th Day Adventure Club </h3>
                        <p>I know we've said this before but The 8th Day really is one of the most active clubs in
                            London.
                            The club covers many more activities than just climbing, ranging from mountain biking to
                            dragon
                            boating and a whole heap in-between.
                            Whilst not a specific climbing club, they do have a group of climbers who meet at Mile End
                            wall
                            every Monday and visit the other walls sporadically. As Mile End has a lot of bouldering
                            complete beginners are welcome to go and get stuck in to see if they like it. </p>
                        <p> The club also arranges the occasional outdoor climbing session around the UK and beyond and
                            members also often take their kit on the many mulit-activity weekends to the likes of
                            Snowdonia/Devon/Peak District etc and so combine climbing with whatever else is going on.
                            It's a nice relaxed club with the opportunity to do other stuff alongside climbing too. The
                            8th
                            Day really is one of the best multi-sport clubs in London and we can't speak more highly of
                            them
                            (it might be due to the fact that one of the London Climbing Guide crew has actually been a
                            member of the 8th Day!).</p>

                        <p> The Alpine Club, is the world's first mountaineering club, has members from around the
                            world. It
                            was founded in 1857 and since then they have been at the leading edge of worldwide
                            mountaineering development and exploration.

                            The Alpine Club is for experienced mountaineers and climbers only!

                            To become a full member you must have first have climber at least 20 alpine climbs or

                            but we would recommend you join one of the other clubs listed here to gain experience. </p>
                        <p>The Alpine Club promotes a code of climbing ethics, which seeks to protect mountains,
                            mountain
                            regions and their people from any harmful impact by climbers. The club is globally
                            recognized as
                            influential on these issues. Membership to the Alpine club entry really is one of the
                            aspirations of any climber/mountaineer.</p>

                        <p>While not as zany as some of the others on this list, Nanga Parbat’s status as the
                            world’s
                            fastest-growing mountain seems worth a mention. As of 2005, the 8,126-meter (26,660ft)
                            peak is
                            reportedly growing at a rate of 0.27 inches per year, which puts it on track to outstrip
                            Everest
                            as the world’s tallest peak in around 241,000 years. This isn’t particularly exciting,
                            although
                            it does mean that in a quarter of a million years all the Everest record-holding goons
                            may have

                            Ethiopia,

                            record,” she said, “was finding two good rigging spots.” Tyroleans don’t really require
                            any
                            particular skill or fitness level, so was this something any of us could do? Probably.
                            But this
                            scene looks plucked straight out of a Metal Gear game, so I figured it was worth a
